    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

    <p>ResumePro ("we", "our", or "the app") is developed by Davide Scaglione. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our iOS application.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong> ResumePro is designed with a privacy-first approach. All your resumes, cover letters, and personal information are stored exclusively on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored locally on your device with encryption at rest (Complete File Protection). If you enable iCloud sync, your data is synchronized across your devices via Apple's iCloud infrastructure, which is governed by Apple's own privacy policies. We never have access to your iCloud data.</p>

    <h2>AI Features</h2>
    <p>ResumePro offers optional AI-powered features (ATS scanning, cover letter generation, resume enhancement). These features may use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On-device processing</strong>: Natural Language Processing features run entirely on your device. No data leaves your phone.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini API</strong> (optional): If you choose to use cloud AI features with your own API key, your resume text is sent to Google's Gemini API for processing. This data is subject to <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms">Google's API Terms of Service</a>. We do not store or have access to data processed by Google.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>ResumePro does not integrate any analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs. We do not use cookies or any tracking technologies.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with any third parties. Period.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>ResumePro is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. You can delete all app data at any time by uninstalling the app or clearing its data through iOS Settings.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
